You are a Principal Engineer with deep experience in backend architecture and protocol-level integrations. Your task is to build a **sample local MCP weather server in C#**, using the **official SDK** provided in this documentation:

ðŸ”— https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server#c%23

### ðŸ›  OBJECTIVE

1. Implement a **working MCP server** in C# using the SDK
2. Ensure it runs **locally** and demonstrates how to **connect it to a basic host/client**
3. Include **inline comments** on all **primary logic points** (not every line)

### ðŸ“‹ REQUIREMENTS

- Language: **C#**
- Approach: Use the **official MCP SDK only**
- Documentation: Follow the linked MCP Quickstart doc
- Final Output: Provide complete code, including necessary setup. Use the latest version.

### ðŸ”’ CONSTRAINTS
- **Only comment on key logic** (e.g., server initialization, registration, message handlers, core flows)
- Skip boilerplate explanations unless essential for understanding
- Focus on clarity, simplicity, and local testability
- Minimize placeholder code unless unavoidable
- Do **not** use external frameworks beyond whatâ€™s needed by the SDK
